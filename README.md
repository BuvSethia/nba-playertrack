# nba-playertrack
The frontend of my Senior Thesis project for Barrett, The Honors College at Arizona State University (Jan 2014 - Nov 2014). This repository is the actual iOS app. Now deprecated due to changes to Basketball Reference's HTML structure changes, Bing's Search API deprecation, and me not having the money for servers and databases.
I might bring it back to life one day. For now, it's the biggest individual project I've worked on.

## Server side functionality
The repo containing the REST API and other server side functionality:

https://github.com/BuvSethia/nba-playertrack-server-files

## Improvements
Unit tests

Better architecture to reduce coupling

Integration tests

End to end tests

etc...
