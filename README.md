# nba-playertrack
My Senior Thesis project for Barrett, The Honors College at Arizona State University. This repository is the actual iOS app. Now deprecated due to changes to Basketball Reference's HTML structure changes, Bing's Search API deprecation, and me not having the money for servers and databases.
I might bring it back to life one day. For now, it's the biggest individual project I've worked on.

## Improvements
Unit tests
Better architecture to reduce coupling
Integration tests
End to end tests
etc...
